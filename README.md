# msq-rs

Rust library implementation of the legacy [Master Server Query Protocol](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Master_Server_Query_Protocol).

- [Documentation](https://docs.rs/msq/)
- [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/msq)
- [Repository](https://github.com/nullsystem/msq-rs)
- [Release Notes](https://github.com/nullsystem/msq-rs/releases)

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```
[dependencies]
msq = "0.2"
```

If you want to get straight from the latest master branch:

```
[dependencies]
msq = { git = "https://github.com/nullsystem/msq-rs.git" }
```

To get started using msq, see the Quick Start section below
and take a look at the [documentation (stable)](https://docs.rs/msq/).

### Features

By default, both async `MSQClient` and non-async/blocking `MSQClientBlock` are included.
However, if you want to only include one or the other, you could do the following:

For non-async/`MSQClientBlock` only:

```
[dependencies]
msq = { version = "0.2", default-features = false, features = ["non-async"] }
```

For async/`MSQClient` only:

```
[dependencies]
msq = { version = "0.2", default-features = false, features = ["async"] }
```

## Quick Start

```rust
use msq::{MSQClient, Region, Filter};
use std::io::Result;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // Startup the client
    let mut client = MSQClient::new().await?;

    // Connect to the master server
    client.connect("hl2master.steampowered.com:27011").await?;

    let servers = client
        .query(Region::Europe,  // Restrict query to Europe region
            Filter::new()       // Create a Filter builder
                .appid(240)     // appid of 240 (CS:S)
                .nand()         // Start of NAND special filter
                    .map("de_dust2")     // Map is de_dust2
                    .empty(true)         // Server is empty
                .end()          // End of NAND special filter
                .gametype(&vec!["friendlyfire", "alltalk"])).await?;

    // nand filter excludes servers that has de_dust2 as
    // its map and is empty

    // nand and nor are both special filters, both closed by
    // using the end method

    Ok(())
}
```

### Blocking/Non-Async version

If you don't want to use async, then a blocking version is available. The
methods functionalities and names should matches its async counterpart.

```rust
use msq::{MSQClientBlock, Region, Filter};
use std::io::Result;

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let mut client = MSQClientBlock::new()?;
    client.connect("hl2master.steampowered.com:27011")?;

    let servers = client
        .query(Region::Europe,  // Restrict query to Europe region
            Filter::new()       // Create a Filter builder
                .appid(240)     // appid of 240 (CS:S)
                .nand()         // Start of NAND special filter
                    .map("de_dust2")     // Map is de_dust2
                    .empty(true)         // Server is empty
                .end()          // End of NAND special filter
                .gametype(&vec!["friendlyfire", "alltalk"]))?;
    Ok(())
}
```

## API Changes

### From v0.1.X to v0.2.X

- REMOVED: `msq::region` and `msq::filter` modules are no longer exposed. Just use
  `msq::Region` enum and `msq::Filter` struct directly.
- REPLACED: `as_string` replaces `as_str` in `msq::Filter`
- NEW: `single_query` method in `msq::MSQClient` and `msq::MSQClientBlock` to do a
  single query in one function
- NEW: `msq::MSQClientBlock` for a non-async version
- NEW: Can now define features `async` and `non-async`. Both are enabled by default.
